                        Hello! I am Akane Simpson. I am a senior at Grambling State University majoring in Computer Science. I am expected to graduate in May of 2018. I have a passion for creating something new and helping to solve problems for others!

I have a keen interest in Web Development using popular technologies such as the three main ones (HTML, CSS, and Javascript). Additionally, I have experience in using Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and Data Structures primarily for my school work or on major projects. Languages that I am proficeint in are Java and Python. I also have a basic understanding in C# and APS.NET framework.

Some of the major frameworks that I am currently using are Nodejs and Expressjs. Additionally, I have a keen interest in understanding and developing full stack technologies for businesses.
